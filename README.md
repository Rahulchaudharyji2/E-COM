 # E-Commerce Website Frontend

Welcome to my **E-Commerce Website Frontend** project! ðŸš€ This project is a custom-built e-commerce website created using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. I have used **GitHub** as an open-source platform to track my code updates and manage my progress.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I was inspired by an online e-commerce website template, but since its source code was **paid**, I decided to **build my own version** with some modifications. This project is my journey in replicating and improving an existing template while making it unique in my way.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **React.js** - For building the frontend UI.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling the website efficiently.
- **GitHub** - For version control and tracking progress.

## ðŸ›  How I Built This
I followed a **step-by-step** approach to complete this project:

1. **Project Setup** â€“ Initialized the React project and configured Tailwind CSS.
2. **Basic Structure** â€“ Created the main components like Navbar, Product Listing, and Footer.
3. **Styling & Responsiveness** â€“ Used Tailwind CSS to make the website fully responsive.
4. **Functionality** â€“ Added features like product cards, filtering options, and basic interactions.
5. **Bug Fixes & Optimization** â€“ Debugged issues and improved performance.
6. **Final Touches** â€“ Polished UI, improved UX, and tested the website thoroughly.

## ðŸ“Œ Planned Features
- I have created a **Reels Section**, but currently, I am unable to use it as it requires the **Instagram Graph API**. Since I don't have much knowledge about it yet, I will add this feature soon.

## ðŸ¤– AI Tools Used
To solve errors and optimize the code, I used:
- **ChatGPT** â€“ Helped in debugging and code suggestions.
- **DeepSeek** â€“ Assisted in resolving complex issues and providing explanations.

## ðŸ“‚ Future Improvements
- Adding **backend functionality** to make the website fully functional.
- Implementing **authentication & payment integration**.
- Enhancing UI/UX with advanced animations.
- Integrating **Instagram Reels** using the **Instagram Graph API**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
This project helped me enhance my **React.js and Tailwind CSS** skills while improving my problem-solving abilities. I also learned how to manage an open-source project on **GitHub** and utilize AI tools for development.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements! ðŸ˜Š
